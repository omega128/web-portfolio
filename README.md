# web-portfolio

This repository houses a copy of my public web-development portfolio site. It is implemented with Bootstrap, CSS, and simple PHP.

My portfolio is intended to be minimalistic. Visitors can find a copy of my resume, thumbnail links to a few sites I worked on, and leave a message through my comment system.
