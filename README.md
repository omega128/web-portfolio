# web-portfolio

This repository is a copy of my public web-development portfolio site.

This portfolio is intended to be minimalistic. Visitors can find a copy of my resume, thumbnail links to a few sites I worked on, and leave a message through my comment system. It was uses Bootstrap, and simple PHP.
