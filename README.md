# web-portfolio

This is a copy of my public web-development portfolio site. It was implemented using Bootstrap and simple PHP.

This portfolio is intended to be minimalistic. On it, visitors can find a copy of my resume, follow thumbnail links to a few sites I worked on, and leave a message through my comment system.
